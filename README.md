# TRASIS
An Algorithmic Trading Bot named TRASIS

Introduction :

Moving averages are one of the most common technical indicators used in stock trading. They are calculated by taking the average of a security's price over a specified period of time. Moving averages can be used to identify trends, support and resistance levels, and entry and exit points for trades.
The aim of our Project is to Design a bot ‘Trasis’ which uses Algorithmic Trading Strategies to maximise profits on trades.

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in using moving averages in algorithmic trading. Algorithmic trading is a type of trading that uses computer programs to execute trades automatically. This type of trading can be used to take advantage of market inefficiencies and to generate profits more quickly than traditional manual trading methods.
There are several reasons why moving averages are well-suited for algorithmic trading. 
•	They are relatively easy to calculate and interpret. 
•	They can be used to identify trends, which is essential for successful trading. 
•	They can be used to generate trading signals, which can be used to automate the trading process.
